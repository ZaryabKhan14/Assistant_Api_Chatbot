Normal Question Handling: If a user asks a general question, the assistant should provide a straightforward answer based on its knowledge and capabilities.

File-Based Responses: If a user's question pertains to the contents of a PDF file, the assistant should be able to process the uploaded PDF and extract information to provide a relevant answer.

It indicates that users can upload a file either by dragging and dropping it into a specified area or by using a "Browse files" button, with a limit of 200MB per PDF file.

To give a proper description:

The interface is clean and user-friendly, with a simple instruction to upload a PDF file.
The UI elements include an upload area and a button for browsing files.
It appears designed for collaborative use, as there is a prompt suggesting to join an organization for a more fun experience.
There's a running status indicator, suggesting that the application might process files in real-time or that it operates on a server.
This chatbot interface seems to be hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, which is a platform for deploying and sharing machine learning models. The use of Hugging Face implies that the chatbot may use advanced natural language processing models to interact with users and understand the contents of PDF files.
